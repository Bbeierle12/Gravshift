# 🔄 Gravshift - Refactoring & Polish Update

## ✅ Completed Improvements

### 🏗️ **1. Refactored main.js**

#### Extracted Rendering Logic
- Created **`RenderManager.js`** - handles all rendering operations
- Separated render stats tracking (FPS, frame time, draw calls)
- Added debug overlay (toggle with **F3**)
- Performance monitoring for object pools

#### Consolidated Input Handling
- Created **`InputManager.js`** - centralized keyboard/mouse handling
- Hotkey registration system for extensible controls
- Helper methods: `getMovementVector()`, `isBoostPressed()`, `isRecyclePressed()`
- Event listener management with on/off methods

#### Unified Entity Update Loop
- Single `updateEntities()` method instead of scattered updates
- Consolidated debris spawning and update logic
- Cleaner game loop structure

**Before:**
```javascript
// Scattered update calls
this.engine.update(deltaTime);
this.effects.update(deltaTime);
this.spawnDebris(deltaTime);
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Unified update
this.updateEntities(deltaTime);
```

### 🎨 **2. Improved UI/UX**

#### Sidebar Design (Replaces Modals)
- **Collapsible sidebar** on right side of screen
- Toggle with **Tab** key or click button
- Smooth slide-in/out animation
- Always accessible during gameplay

#### Sidebar Sections:
1. **🎯 Missions** - Current mission progress and rewards
2. **🏆 Achievements** - Unlock counter and quick view
3. **⌨️ Hotkeys** - All controls at a glance
4. **📊 Stats** - Time, debris absorbed, difficulty, missions completed

#### Collapsible Sections
- Click section headers to expand/collapse
- Saves screen space
- Better information hierarchy

### ⚡ **3. Rebalanced Progression**

#### Smoother Tier Curve
**Old System (7 tiers):**
- Tier 2: 5 mass
- Tier 3: 15 mass (+200%)
- Tier 4: 35 mass (+133%)
- Tier 5: 70 mass (+100%)
- Tier 6: 120 mass (+71%)
- Tier 7: 200 mass (+67%)

**New System (8 tiers):**
- Tier 2: 3 mass
- Tier 3: 8 mass (+167%)
- Tier 4: 18 mass (+125%)
- Tier 5: 35 mass (+94%)
- Tier 6: 60 mass (+71%)
- Tier 7: 100 mass (+67%)
- Tier 8: 150 mass (+50%)

**Benefits:**
- Faster early progression (tier 2 at 3 vs 5)
- More consistent growth curve
- Better pacing throughout game
- Extra tier for extended play

#### Updated Missions
- Aligned with new tier thresholds
- 9 total missions (added tier 8 mission)
- Rewards scale with difficulty

### 🎯 **4. Improved Difficulty Scaling**

**Old Formula:**
```javascript
difficulty = 1 + floor(time / 60) * 0.5
// Pure time-based (can be grindy)
```

**New Formula:**
```javascript
powerLevel = mass * tier
timeFactor = min(time / 60, 5) // Capped at 5 min
difficulty = 1 + (powerLevel / 100) * 0.7 + timeFactor * 0.3
// 70% player power, 30% time
```

**Benefits:**
- Difficulty scales with player strength
- Prevents overwhelming beginners
- Rewards skilled players appropriately
- Time influence capped to prevent endless grinding

---

### ⌨️ **5. Global Hotkeys**

**Implemented Hotkeys:**
- **ESC** - Pause game
- **F3** - Toggle debug overlay
- **Tab** - Toggle sidebar
- **1-9** - Reserved for future features (extensible)

**System Features:**
- Easy hotkey registration: `registerHotkey(key, callback)`
- Cleanup on game quit
- Prevents default browser actions when needed
- Centralized management
